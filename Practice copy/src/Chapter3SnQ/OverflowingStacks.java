 * data structureSetOf Stacks that mimics this. SetOf Stacks should be 
 * composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the 
 * previous one exceeds capacity. SetOf Stacks. push() and SetOf Stacks. 
 * pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is,popO should 
 * return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
